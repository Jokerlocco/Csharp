/*
Create a class "House", with an attribute "area", a constructor that 
sets its value and a method "ShowData" to display "I am a house, my 
area is 200 m2" (instead of 200, it will show the real surface). 
Include getters an setters for the area, too.

The "House" will contain a door. Each door will have an attribute 
"color" (a string), and a method "ShowData" which will display "I am a 
door, my color is brown" (or whatever color it really is). Include a 
getter and a setter. Also, create a "GetDoor" in the house.

A "SmallApartment" is a subclass of House, with a preset area of 50 m2.

Also create a class Person, with a name (string). Each person will have 
a house. The method "ShowData" for a person will display his/her name, 
show the data of his/her house and the data of the door of that house.

Write a Main to create a SmallApartment, a person to live in it, and to 
show the data of the person.
